# skirouteoptimization
Implementing the chinese postman algorithm to find the best way to ski all lifts and runs of a ski resort in minimal time.

Following two tutorials - http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/intro-to-graph-optimization-solving-cpp/ and https://algorithms.discrete.ma.tum.de/graph-algorithms/directed-chinese-postman/index_en.html - I have implemented a version of the chinese postman algorithm in a directed graph to find an optimal solution to ski every lift and run of a ski area.

While definitely not perfect, it is a reasonable attempt and could, theoretically, be adapted for every skiing area. The main effort is writing down lifts as nodes and edges in a .csv.
